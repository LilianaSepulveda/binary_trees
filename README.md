![Different Types of Binary Tree](https://i.imgur.com/KJAm8lK.jpg)

_Binary_ Tree is a Tree data structure where every node has at most 2 children.

In this group project we will work to expand knowledge about what a binary tree is, the difference between a binary tree and a binary tree, the potential gain in terms of time complexity compared to the related list, the same depth. We also investigate and cover topics on different traversal methods for traversing a binary tree, a complete, complete, perfect, and balanced binary tree.

### Learning Objectives
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
