# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

![Different Types of Binary Tree](https://i.imgur.com/KJAm8lK.jpg)

_Binary_ Tree is a Tree data structure where every node has at most 2 children.

In this group project we will work to expand knowledge about what a binary tree is, the difference between a binary tree and a binary tree, the potential gain in terms of time complexity compared to the related list, the same depth. We also investigate and cover topics on different traversal methods for traversing a binary tree, a complete, complete, perfect, and balanced binary tree.
